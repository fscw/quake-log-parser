# Tasklist for the Quake 3 Arena Log Parsing Project

## Initial Project Setup

- [x] Set up the Golang development environment
  - [x] Install Golang on the system
  - [x] Configure the Go module for the project (`go mod init quake_log_parser`)

- [x] Structure the Project
  - [x] Create the directory and file structure:
    - `main.go`
    - `app/parser/parser.go`
    - `app/parser/parser_test.go`
    - `app/reports/reports.go`
    - `app/reports/reports_test.go`
    - `logs/qgames.log`

## Feature Implementation

- [x] Implement the Main Function (`main.go`)
  - [x] Initialize the parser and call functions to process the log and generate reports

- [x] Implement the Parser (`parser/parser.go`)
  - [x] Create the `ParseLogFile` function to read the log file
  - [x] Implement logic to identify and separate each match
  - [x] Implement the `parseKill` function to extract data from kill lines
  - [x] Implement the `processKill` function to update match data based on kills
  - [x] Implement the `meansOfDeath` function to map death codes to their descriptions

- [x] Define Data Structures
  - [x] Create the `Match` structure to store match data (`parser/match.go`)
  - [x] Create the `Kill` structure to store kill data (`parser/kill.go`)

- [x] Report Generation
  - [x] Implement the `GenerateReport` function to generate detailed reports for each match and display them in the console

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] Unit Tests
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the `ParseLogFile` function
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the `parseKill` function
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the `processKill` function
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the `meansOfDeath` function

- [ ] Functional Tests
  - [ ] Test the complete flow of reading the log file and generating reports
  - [ ] Validate that the report data matches expectations based on the sample log

## Improvements and Optimizations

- [ ] Performance Improvements
  - [ ] Optimize log file reading for large data volumes
  - [ ] Evaluate and implement improvements in the efficiency of kill and match processing

- [ ] Error Handling
  - [ ] Implement robust error handling for file reading and parsing
  - [ ] Ensure errors are logged clearly and informatively

## Documentation and Finalization

- [ ] Code Documentation
  - [ ] Document all functions with clear and descriptive comments
  - [x] Create a README with setup and execution instructions for the project

- [ ] Final Refinement
  - [ ] Review code for cleanup and standardization
  - [ ] Perform final testing and complete system validation

## Additional Tasks (Optional)

- [x] Additional Report Generation
  - [x] Implement the generation of reports for deaths grouped by cause of death
